# InstantLaTeX

A fun site I whipped up - it allows you to type in LaTeX and TeX and see it instantly rendered.

Anyone who has used LaTeX/TeX knows that it can be a right pain to recompile your documents every time you make a change in your source.

So this tool lets you preview your mathematics instantly and easily.
