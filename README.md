# InstantLaTeX

A fun site I whipped up - it allows you to type in LaTeX and TeX and see it instantly rendered.

Anyone who has used LaTeX/TeX knows that it can be a right pain to recompile your documents every time just to preview a small change in your source.

This tool lets you preview your mathematics instantly and easily.

- sharelatex.com (freemium)
